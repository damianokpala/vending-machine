Certainly! Let's break down the Vending Machine project requirements into smaller tasks:

1. **Initialization and Snack Selection:**
   - Initialize the Vending Machine with available snacks, their prices, and quantities.
   - Display the list of available snacks with their respective codes, prices, and quantities.
   - Prompt the user to input the code of the snack they want to purchase.

2. **Check Availability:**
   - Check if the selected snack is available in the inventory.
   - If the snack is out of stock, display a message and prompt the user to choose another snack.

3. **Payment Processing:**
   - Prompt the user to insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) to make the payment.
   - Calculate the total amount inserted and display the remaining amount needed if it's insufficient for the selected snack.

4. **Transaction Completion:**
   - If the user inserts enough money to purchase the snack, process the transaction.
   - Deduct the price of the snack from the total amount inserted.
   - Update the inventory quantity for the purchased snack.
   - Provide the selected snack to the user.
   - If the user has inserted more money than required, provide change.

5. **Check Inventory:**
   - Keep track of the inventory for each snack.
   - Display a message when the quantity of a particular snack is low.
   - Remove snacks from the list of available options if they run out of stock.

6. **Exit and Report:**
   - Provide an option for the user to exit the Vending Machine.
   - If the user selects the exit option, display a report showing the remaining quantities of all available snacks and the total revenue earned from transactions.

7. **Refill and Add Snacks (Optional):**
   - Implement a feature that allows the operator to refill the inventory and add new snacks to the machine.
   - Provide suitable options in the program to perform these tasks.

**Bonus Challenge (Optional):**

8. **User Accounts (Optional):**
   - Implement a feature that allows users to create accounts with unique IDs and passwords.
   - Users can log in to the Vending Machine using their accounts and track their transaction history and remaining balance.
   - Support the creation and management of user accounts for the machine operator.

9. **Discounts and Special Offers (Optional):**
   - Add support for discounts and special offers on certain snacks.
   - Apply discounts automatically when the user selects eligible snacks.

Each of these tasks can be implemented as methods and functions within the Vending Machine class. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks, you can focus on one feature at a time and gradually build a functional and interactive Vending Machine program using OOP principles. Happy coding!
